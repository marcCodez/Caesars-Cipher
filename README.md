In this project I created a Caeasars Cipher decoder also known as the shift cipher. It will decode an input of words in uppercase that are shifted by a set amount of 13.

Instructions

1. First encode your text in a Caesars Cipher, you can do it the faster way via this website: https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher
2. Under "Caesar Encoder" type your desired text in upper case format and click "ENCRYPT BY CAESAR CODE"
3. Copy the output to the left of the screen
4. Open the decoder: https://marccodez.github.io/Caesars-Cipher/
5. Open developer tools on Google Chrome and click the console tab
6. Invoke the function rot13() and pass in your copied text
